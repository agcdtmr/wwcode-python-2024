# Challenge: Create a program that swaps the values of two variables.

print("                                             ")
variableOne = input("Type your first random variable: ")

print("                                             ")
print("These are your random variables BEFORE swapping")
print("First random variable: ", variableOne)
print("Second random variable: ", variableTwo)


# Swappin'

temporaryHolder = variableOne
variableOne = variableTwo
variableTwo = temporaryHolder

# Python Days of Code Challenge - Day 1

# How It Works:
# - 60 Days, 60 Questions: Dive into daily Python challenges, each marking a step closer to coding mastery. You can start anytime in between as well!

# Learning Together:
# - [ ] Share your solutions, ask questions, and connect with fellow coders in this thread or on social media (Twitter, LinkedIn) - or Github!
# - [ ] Don't forget to tag us @WWCodePython or use the hashtags #WomenWhoCodePython #PythonDaysofCode so we can celebrate your achievements!

# Bonus:
# - [ ] React to today’s question if you’d like us to solve this LIVE in our upcoming Python Code Jam Sessions

# Today's Challenge:
# - [ ] Create a program that swaps the values of two variables.
# ```

# ### Daily goals:
